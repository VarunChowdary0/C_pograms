/*
    High-level, low-level, and middle-level languages are terms used to classify programming
    languages based on their level of abstraction and proximity to machine code. Each level
    of language offers different trade-offs between ease of use, control over hardware, and 
    portability. Let's differentiate among these three types of programming languages:

    1. High-Level Language:
        High-level languages are designed to be more human-readable and user-friendly, 
        making it easier for programmers to write code without needing an in-depth 
        understanding of the underlying hardware. These languages are characterized 
        by a higher level of abstraction from the hardware details.

        Examples: Python, Java, C++, Ruby, Swift.

    2. Middle-Level Language:
        Middle-level languages, also known as "intermediate-level languages," 
        strike a balance between high-level and low-level languages. 
        They offer some level of abstraction while still providing access to 
        hardware-specific details. Middle-level languages are often used to bridge 
        the gap between high-level languages and machine code.

        Examples: C, Pascal.

    3. Low-Level Language:
        Low-level languages are closely tied to the hardware architecture 
        of a computer system. They provide minimal abstraction and allow 
        programmers to write code that is more directly executed by the CPU. 
        These languages are used for tasks that require fine-grained control 
        over hardware resources and performance optimization.

        Examples: Assembly languages (x86 assembly, ARM assembly).
