    Computer Hardware :
        Computer hardware refers to the physical components responsible to the storage, 
        processing and input/output operations. These are some important hardware components
        in a computer.
        1-> Central Processing Unit (CPU) :
            Often known as brain of the computer, preforms calculations and manages the 
            data.
        2-> Random Access Memory (RAM) :
            RAM is volitile memory that stores the data processed by CPU or CPU is working
            on. It allows the quick access of data for better performance. 
        3-> Storage (SSD/HDD) :
            These devices are used to store the data perminantly even when the computer is
            turned off.
            SSD [Solid State Drivers]
            HDD [Hard Disk Drivers]
        4-> Moterboard :
            Motherboard is the main circuit board which connects all the hardware componts
            like CPU, RAM ,Storade devices, Input/Output devices.
        5-> Input/Output Devices:
            These are the devices that are used to perform input and output operation by user 
            and computer
            Input Devices       Output Devices
              Keyboard              moniter
              mouse                 speakers 
              scanner               printer
    Computer software :
        Computer software refers to the set of instructions given to a computer to preform
        specific tasks. Unlike hardware, softwares are various types.
        1-> System Software :
            System software includes the operating system of a computer (windows , linux ,MAC ).
            This provides the user interface to the user.
        2-> Application Software :
            These Appication softwares are designed to perform a specific task for the user.
            Examples : Web Browser , Video player , Application stores etc .,
        3-> Programming Languages : 
            Programming languages are used by developers to develoup the software applications
        4-> Firmware :
            It is a type of software that is preminatly stored in hardware to preform BIOS 
            (Basic Input Output Operatios) or Device controll.
